// private functions are useful when we want to do something within the class but we forbid the usage out of the class.

// helper functions within the class are usually put in private.

// everything is visibile within a class, you can access private sections WITHIN a class. 

// If Foo() is private function, Entity::Foo() is not available outside of the class, we cannot use that function. Only other functions can use it.
