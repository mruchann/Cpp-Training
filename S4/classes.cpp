// Class names should be unique.

// use struct when doing simple things
// use classes whenever functionality or complexity is needed.

struct Player {

};

class Player {

};

// In C++, instance <-> object

// instantiate -> create (used in class context)
// instantiate -> creating a variable belongs to a class


// variables that are made from classes -> objects
// new object variable -> instance
// creating a new object variable -> instantiate
// create a new instance -> instantiate a player object

// by default, class members are private; whereas in structs they are public.
